## Goals

Produce *short-term* (a year forward) and *long-term* (several years later) forecasts for **land transfer duty** (LTD). 

::: {.callout-note}
- Data is from several resources (ABS, etc.):
  - fetched by the DTF
  - initial data quality checks performed by the DTF
  - further data checks and EDA required
  - produce forecast and reconcile
:::

## Value 

::: {.callout-note}
- How *LTD* affected by other factors (e.g. sales, hvi, interest rate, etc.)
- Trend and seasonality of LTD
- Any acts (taxes, subsidise) or regulations required (monetary, fiscal policy)
:::

## Approach Overview

::: {.callout-note}
Consists of 3 parts:

- Model fitting

- Forecast

- Reconciliation
:::

## Model fitting

::: {.callout-tip}
Models are considered:

- VAR
- VECM
- ETS
- ARIMA

::: {.fragment .fade-in}
The model choice based on data traits, chosen based on accuracy test
:::

## Forecasting

Advanced forecasting method from creating hierarchical and grouped time series

::: {.callout-tip}
- Disaggregate time series into a hierarchical structure
  - cross-sectional
  - temporal
  - cross-temporal
- Fit model to all levels
- Forecast!!

:::

## Reconciliation

::: {.fragment .highlight-red}
**PROBLEM!!**
:::

::: {.fragment .fade-in}
::: {.callout-important}
## Something doesn't add up here...

Independently produced forecasts are [**incoherent**]{.danger},

$\text{LTD}_{T+h|T} \neq \text{Residential}_{T+h|T} + \text{Non-residential}_{T+h|T}$.

## Reconciliation

::: {.callout-tip}

## Impose constraints to ensure coherency

Adjust the forecasts to satisfy the constraint

$\text{LTD}_{T+h|T} = \text{Residential}_{T+h|T} + \text{Non-residential}_{T+h|T}$.

::: {.fragment .fade-in}
<br>
Often we have many constraints, so matrices are used:

$$
\begin{bmatrix}
  \text{LTD}_{t} \\
  \text{Residential}_{t} \\
  \text{Non-residential}_{t} \\
\end{bmatrix}
=
\begin{bmatrix}
  1 & 1 \\
  1 & 0\\
  0 & 1 \\
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}
  \text{Residential}_{t} \\
  \text{Non-residential}_{t} \\
\end{bmatrix}
$$

or compactly, $\mathbf{y}_t = \mathbf{S} \mathbf{b}_t$

## Reconciliation

::: {.callout-tip}
**Few reconciliation methods:**

- *Traditional*
  - bottom-up
  - top-down
  - middle-out
  
- *MinT optimal reconciliation*
  - variance scaling
  - structural scaling
  - shrinkage minT
